### GOALS 
- Acquire as much knowledge as possible, 
- Share Knowledge
- Grow as a Developer
- Conribute to Tech Communities 

 #### NOTE!
* Build as much as you can, great engineers build things.


My focus as a Developer is it make sure end users get the most optimal experience and retain customers thus acquiring more visitors as well. Adding value to organizations through tools that I have in my toolbox is one of the things that inspire me to learn, learn and learn.

Obtaining my BSc in Business Information Technology from the Malawi University Of Science And Technology is one of the greatest experiences I've had, I met a diverse group of creatives that helped me enhance my development skills.

As a developer, every day is a lesson, from Frameworks, Programming languages, as well as new Database Systems being developed. 

I had to pick up the GO programming language due to some use cases it solved very efficiently, now I see myself refactoring my python code to Go, but I'm still a Pythonista for life.

Due to the fact that we get to learn every day, there are some people that don't enjoy watching YouTube tutorials or can't afford to stream a 40-minute video and thus prefer reading an article or a walk-through for them to get other points accidentally omitted by a YouTube video.

I love sharing knowledge, every new thing I learn, I'm ready to share it with the community.
